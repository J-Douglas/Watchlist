tarantino uses his characteristically prolonged dialogue and <i>seemingly pointless</i> scenes to produce an ending unlike anything i’ve ever seen. but perhaps that’s due to my developing cinema knowledge.
 
i applaud the advertising/marketing for this movie. the one thing i knew beforehand left me waiting and waiting which turned out to be the biggest twist of them all!

I think everyone would agree that Gilligan directing <i>El Camino</i> was necessary. I believe this sequel does an excellent job of not straying from its focus: Jesse. While the Walter-Jesse relationship was essential to the success of the series, it was already incredibly complex and didn’t need any more development. Making any significant changes to the Walter-Jesse relationship would take away from what the show was able to accomplish in my opinion. Last, the movie offers closure to Jesse’s character arc without taking away from the series’ finale.",,2019-10-14

To hell with them. <i>The Irishman</i>, a.k.a<i> I Heard You Paint Houses</i>, is a masterclass in acting, storytelling/script writing, and cinematography.

Every single part of the movie had purpose. The story takes time to build the most character defining moments for our antihero, particularly near the end. As is typical of Scorsese, the thought-provoking ending is ripe with symbolism. 

<i>The Irishman</i> has shown me how immersive a quiet but eloquent story can be. Moreover, I’m impressed by the immediate impact its had on my taste and standard for movies.",,2020-07-02

2020-07-23,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,1999,https://boxd.it/1gq3pH,2.5,,"Some difficulties in the plot direction and not very good CGI. It also had a bit too much politics and unnecessary dialogue. BUT, I think this movie gets a little more hate than it necessarily deserves. As I understand it, this movie is trying to introduce the SW universe to a new generation and so I don’t have a huge problem with them trying younger humour. I find it harder to be critical of the movie when it clearly had a different direction and goal to the original trilogy. I think they may have realized they didn’t hit the mark with this one and altered the tone of the next two. 

Enjoyed the pod race (even if it was a bit too long) and seeing the backstories for several familiar characters. Ending fight scene was pretty cool. I actually think Darth Maul’s appearance is kinda neat. He does his job as being a mysterious villain so I don’t really have too big of a problem with his character design. 

One last thing I will say is that I didn’t notice the music as much in this movie other than at the ending :(. I don’t think this is entirely John Williams’ fault, however, and I think the lack of more signature SW score is partly attributed to the plot.
